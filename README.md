## GiftEasy - A web application built using MERN stack along with admin dashboard and payment facilities

### Tools used for this web application: 
- Nodejs and express (for our custom backend and API routing)
- React js (for our frontend ui and routing)
- MongoDB (for storing database data)

In order to use this repo, first clone this repository. <br/>
The next steps need to be followed:
1. We have to install all the dependencies under package.json outside the backend folder. We can do this by typing the following in terminal:
```$ npm i ```

2. We have to install all the dependencies under package.json within the frontend folder:
``` $ npm i ``` 
3. We have to create the build folder under frontend within which the index.html is present and connected to the backend by typing the following command: 
``` $ npm run build ```
4. Finally we have to run the website locally by typing the following command in the terminal:
``` $ npm start ``` 

We have also hosted the website in heroku.
